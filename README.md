# Overview
This project includes the Python language and Jupyter Notebook. In this project, we compare and analyze different data of uber analysis.

This project uses the Python language. In this project, we are analyzing the dataset.

This project contains the Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and, Seaborn. The Pandas library is used to import different types of datasets.
The NumPy library is used for manipulating and performing on the arrays. The Matplotlib library is used for plotting the graphs. The seaborn library is used for plotting the heatmap.

First, implement the dataset from the Kaggle site. There you get the different types of datasets.

Then import the dataset using Pandas library and start preprocessing it. After preprocessing use the Matplotlib and Seaborn library for comparing the dataset. 

From the dataset, we are comparing business vs personal trips, the frequency for the purpose of the trip, checking how many are the round trips, evaluating the frequency of the trip in each month, and so on.
